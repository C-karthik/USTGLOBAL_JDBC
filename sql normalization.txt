Functional Depedency :

A relationship that exist such as an attributes that determains  another attributes uniquly.

eg: R-->{x,y}
      x-->y (x determines y and y dependency function)

3 types --->1.total func 
            2.partial func
            3.transitive func

1.total func : if all atributes of a relation determine by key atribute that is know as total functional dep.

                                           eg:r-->{A,s,d,f}
                                               A-->s,d,f
2.partial fun dependency : A relation set to have partial fun dep if it consists of composite key attributes ; 
                           there exist an pair dep such that an attribute can be determain another attribute.

                                       eg: R-->{A,S,d,f}
                                           A,S-->(s,d)

3.transitive func :   a relation is said to have TFD if there exist relation such that an key atribute determine
                         an non-attribute which in turn determine another key attribute  
                                    
                                        eg: R-->{A,S,d,f}
                                            A->d
                                            S->f
                                            A->f
Normalization : the process of decomposing the table into small table in  order to reduce retensity and anomoly.
  
Normal forms : A state of table without retendency and anomoly(prblm occuring during dml operation like insert ,delete, update)

     3types ----------1.A table is said to be first normal form if it satifies following conds a.A table shoud not contain duplicate records
                                                                                               b.Every cell in a table should be a single value

                  ----2.A table is said to be second normal form if it satifies following conds a. 1Nf
                                                                                                b. not contain partial dependency

                  ----3.A table is said to be third normal form if it satifies following conds a.1NF
                                                                                               b.2NF
                                                                                               c. it should not have transitive dependency
